In order to segement the neighborhoods and explore them, we will essentially need a dataset that contains the number of boroughs in the neighborhoods, along with the co-ordinates of each neighborhood.\n\nData 2 : Farmers Markets and Food Boxes: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/DOHMH-Farmers-Markets-and-Food-Boxes/8vwk-6iz2\n\nIn order to have a better insight of the availibility of the raw materials,an analysis of the major Farmers Markets and Food Boxes in the neighborhood is necessary, which aide the business.
